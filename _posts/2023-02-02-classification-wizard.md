A nice tool to make classifications "on the fly"!
It is based on **scikit-lern** library and can manage some standard binary and non-binary classification algorithms.
It is possible to configure hyperparameters, to create plottings and to check metrics.
There is a very useful link to save the hyperparameters configuration and it's possible to save forecasts as well.
