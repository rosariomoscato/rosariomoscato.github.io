A nice classification tool, simply drag and drop your data and you'll get your results. No coding required! Just run it and open the website!

It is based on **scikit-learn** library and can manage some standard binary and non-binary classification algorithms.
It is possible to configure hyperparameters, to create plottings and to check metrics.
There is a very useful link to save the hyperparameters configuration and it's possible to save forecasts as well.
