A nice tool to make predictions from Time Series.
It is based on **prophet** library and can manage seasonality, holidays and predictors.
It is possible to configure a lot of hyperparameters, to create a lot of dynamic plotting and to make an error analysis.
There is a very useful link to save the results (forecasts, datasets and plotting).
