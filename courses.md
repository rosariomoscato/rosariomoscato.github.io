## Web Applications from Scratch with Streamlit

**Preview or Purchase** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-app-from-scratch-with-streamlit/?referralCode=43AEE09132D5280DB57A)

### Course Description

Let's build and publish Web Applications together from SCRATCH!

Sometimes the best way to learn is not study tons of pages but start doing things together with experts. In this course you are invited to seat together with me coding and making Web Apps step-by-step, instruction after instruction.

Building and Deploying simple and more advanced Web Applications from Scratch using Streamlit is the best way to acquire all the SKILLS needed to create any kind of web application as complex and as big as you want.

In this lessons we see how to build up a simple NLP Web App and a simple tool for Covid-19 Detection leveraging the incredible framework named Streamlit and using packages such as Gensim (for Summary), Text Blob (for Language Detection, Translation and Sentiment Analisys), Spacy (for Tokens and Lemmas), Neat Text (for Text Cleaning), WordCloud (for WordCloud Plotting), Tensorflow (for Predictions/Classification), Pillow (for Images), Open-CV (for Images Enhancement), etc.

Once our Web Apps are completed and Tested we publish them online using Streamlit's Share Service (for this task is required a Github account).

As First BONUS Lesson a CRASH COURSE about Streamlit basic features.

As Second BONUS Lesson a COURSE about Python Coding Environment Setup.

### Course Description

Let's build-up and deploy DEMOs of your Machine Learning Models together from SCRATCH!

Sometimes the best way to learn is not study tons of pages but start doing things together with experts. In this course you are invited to seat together with me coding and making DEMOs step-by-step, instruction after instruction.

Building-up and Deploying simple and more advanced DEMOS of your Machine Leaning Models from Scratch using GRADIO is the best way to acquire all the SKILLS needed to create any kind of web Interface as complex and as big as you want. With this approach you will move from zero to hero in a real blink of an eye!

In these videos we see how to build up a simple Interface and a simple related DEMO leveraging the incredible framework named GRADIO.

In the Advanced Part we learn how to give Login and Authentication features to our DEMOs and how to manage the API to use our Machine Leaning Models with a simple POST call.

Once our Interfaces and DEMOs are completed and tested we publish them online using Huggingface Spaces.

No installations required at all on your machine, we are doing everything online with Google Colab and Huggingface Spaces (for sure if you want you can use you local Jupyter Notebook installation).

### Course Description

Let's build  Videogames together from SCRATCH!

Sometimes the best way to learn is not study tons of pages but start doing things together with experts. In this course you are invited to seat together with me coding and making new videogames step-by-step, instruction after instruction.

Create and Run simple and more advanced Videogames from Scratch using PyGame is the best way to acquire all the SKILLS needed to create any kind of game as complex and as big as you want. With this approach you will move from zero to hero in a real blink of an eye!

In this lessons we see how to build up simple games such as Tic Tac Toe and Pong and much more complex such as Space Invaders and Flappy Bird. In this way we learn gradually how to manage all the required skills to make a good and complete game works well.

Screens, boards, images, sound, explosions, collisions, mouse and keyboard events, movements, screen feedbacks, buttons, sprites and many more concepts and elements are deeply explored, explained and build.

Each game is started from zero, from the importing part of the program, and every single code instruction is written and commented together.

Another very important aspect we are learning together, for example in Pong, is how to "give" some AI to our games in order to make them working by themselves in a CPU Vs CPU simulation mode.

Last but not the least, we are making executables files from our python files, in this way it will be super simple and easy carry our games with us for example in a USB memory stick.

Creating your own game hasn't ever been so enjoyable, start immediately!
