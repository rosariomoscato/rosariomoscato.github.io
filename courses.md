### Course Description

Let's build and publish Web Applications together from SCRATCH!

Sometimes the best way to learn is not study tons of pages but start doing things together with experts. In this course you are invited to seat together with me coding and making Web Apps step-by-step, instruction after instruction.

Building and Deploying simple and more advanced Web Applications from Scratch using Streamlit is the best way to acquire all the SKILLS needed to create any kind of web application as complex and as big as you want.

In this lessons we see how to build up a simple NLP Web App and a simple tool for Covid-19 Detection leveraging the incredible framework named Streamlit and using packages such as Gensim (for Summary), Text Blob (for Language Detection, Translation and Sentiment Analisys), Spacy (for Tokens and Lemmas), Neat Text (for Text Cleaning), WordCloud (for WordCloud Plotting), Tensorflow (for Predictions/Classification), Pillow (for Images), Open-CV (for Images Enhancement), etc.

Once our Web Apps are completed and Tested we publish them online using Streamlit's Share Service (for this task is required a Github account).

As First BONUS Lesson a CRASH COURSE about Streamlit basic features.

As Second BONUS Lesson a COURSE about Python Coding Environment Setup.
